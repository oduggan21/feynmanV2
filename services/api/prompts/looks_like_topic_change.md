Given this context:
 "{context_buffer}"
 and this new segment: 
"{new_segment}"
Does the new segment continue the same concept within the topic, when I ask if it continues the same concept I mean someone could be teaching you about football and specifically talking about touchdowns where they talk about how touchdowns are scored, that fits within the concept, but if they start talking about field goals than that is a new concept and you want to say its a new concept? If not, what is the new concept? Respond as JSON: {{"topic_change": <true/false>, "new_topic": <string or null>}}
